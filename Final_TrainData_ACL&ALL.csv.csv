Internet usage and patient's trust in physician during diagnoses: A knowledge power perspective,"First, this study introduces a relatively comprehensive framework based on the knowledge power perspective. Although Internet search changes patients’ knowledge power (Lenert, 2009), our study analyzes its effect amidst other sources of knowledge power, including a physician's professional status, a patient's chronic conditions, and the execution of power through interaction quality.

A physician's explanation and feedback is still central to a patient's trust (Agius & Stangeland, 2016). Therefore, practitioners need not overreact to patients’ Internet search or regard it as a prominent challenge. On the other hand, this study confirms that physicians should not dismiss patients’ Internet search as trivial (Ahmad et al., 2006), especially when there is diagnosis inconsistency.",JASIST,Theory Proposal

Under the direction of behavioral financial theory, SI is mainly used to simulate the diffusion of influential opinions and its effect on user moods across the social network. More important, SI can help to resolve the problem caused by the disparity in frequency between weibo data and Hushen‐300 time series data. The latter are collected at 5‐minute intervals, and there is not always sufficient weibo data in a given 5‐minute interval to infer a mood.",JASIST,New Algorithm or Method or Technology

The first finds a guideline for using the framework by answering the following research questions:

What is the proper time‐window length to be used while scanning the collection?

When a social network of news actors is utilized, is it necessary to use a large network of news actors instead of exploiting a subset of important actors?
Which similarity method performs better in news‐chain discovery: lexical features using the vector space model, or meta features based on news actors? Can we improve the effectiveness by using multiple methods together in a hybrid approach?
The second compares our method with baselines to answer:

What are the benefits of our framework against baseline approaches?

The MIREX grand challenge: A framework of holistic user‐experience evaluation in music information retrieval,"The article contributes theoretically to MIR evaluation. The holistic user‐experience evaluation approach advocated and implemented in this study is a radical revolution from existing evaluation frameworks including MIREX, MediaEval, and CLEF (discussed later). These existing frameworks focus on subtasks related to components of MIR systems rather than on complete ones. In addition, they largely follow the Cranfield paradigm (Voorhees, 2002), where retrieval systems are compared against common test collections with topics/queries, materials/collections, and relevance/similarity judgments. Putting users and their interactions with complete MIR systems in the center of consideration changes the entire perspective. The evaluation infrastructure no longer consists of predefined queries or ground truth; the evaluation context is shifted from simplified laboratory settings to real‐world scenarios; and the evaluation criteria focus on users' interactions and perceptions. Hopefully, the proposed evaluation framework will inspire more studies on holistic user‐experience evaluation in MIR.",JASIST,Performance Evaluation
The MIREX grand challenge: A framework of holistic user‐experience evaluation in music information retrieval,"As this is, to our knowledge, the first community‐wide, holistic user‐experience evaluation, there are numerous methodological decisions to make in designing and implementing the evaluation framework (the “testbed”).

Rain or shine? Forecasting search process performance in exploratory search tasks,"It was observed that features such as number of snippets, query specific features like length of query, number of tokens in query, and query entropy, were not significantly contributing to discriminating between the classes in the classification models at the early stages (t = 1,2,3) of the search process. This is because there were very few snippets/queries, which were used early during the process when a user is uncertain about the task at hand. In other words, query‐related features were found to be inadequate indicators of search performance in the beginning of an information‐seeking process.",JASIST,Theory Proposal
Rain or shine? Forecasting search process performance in exploratory search tasks,"We also found that later during the process most of the features were found to be contributing significantly to the classification model (addressing RQ2). This finding helps to provide a better structure for process‐focused IR evaluations. Such evaluations could include those utilizing time‐series attributes of a search process in order to assess the effectiveness of a search system or a user, as well as predicting how the search process might look in the future. For instance, one could devise an evaluation metric that is time‐dependent in that it would measure and account for different forms of information objects and user actions for evaluating the goodness of the search process depending on the time (absolute and relative with the overall task).",JASIST,Performance Evaluation

Question types and intermediary elicitations,"On the theoretical side, our work relates to two bodies of literature, question types and elicitations. Prior literature on question types motivates question classification in a number of ways, including shedding light on the nature of librarians' (or other intermediaries') jobs, and as an important first step in automated question answering (Pomerantz, 2005). It has also established question type as an antecedent of other important variables, such as search styles (White & Iivonen, 2001) and the effectiveness of retrieval methods (Keyes, 1996). We contribute to this literature by showing question type as influencing the kinds of clarifications that must be made to provide a good answer. These details have direct practical application to the design of semi‐automated question answering systems, as well as guidance for human intermediaries.",JASIST,Theory Proposal
Question types and intermediary elicitations,"Our work also contributes to the literature on elicitations. Prior literature motivates the importance of elicitation classifications as guiding the design of semi‐automated question‐answering systems (Belkin et al., 1987) and as helpful to training and guiding human intermediaries (Ingwersen, 1992). However, with a few exceptions (e.g., White & Iivonen, 2001) prior literature on elicitations has been mostly descriptive and has not established their causal relationships with other variables. Our study contributes tentative models that relate elicitations to question types, as well as prices. This also opens the door to further research on the value of intermediary elicitations. A practical implication of the relationship between elicitations and price is the feasibility of using question type as the basis for establishing prices for question‐answer services.",JASIST,Theory Proposal

User satisfaction with microblogging: Information dissemination versus social networking,"First, most previous studies used a quantitative approach to explore the usage patterns among microbloggers. These studies crawled data from microblogging sites and used social network analysis to explore how and why people used microblogging. In this study, a different approach was adopted, and an online survey was conducted to identify key motivations for microblogging and to examine how the fulfillment of these motivations affected user satisfaction. This study triangulated the results and provided empirical support for the hypothesis that people use microblogging as an information‐broadcasting platform, rather than as a social networking site. In addition, the empirical investigation demonstrated the relative importance of various antecedent factors for user satisfaction. This study adds to the limited studies on microblogging usage and provides a platform for future research.

User satisfaction with microblogging: Information dissemination versus social networking,"Second, the U&G framework was used to identify the four major types of motivations for microblogging. Specifically, we identified and proposed a new form of motivation (i.e., technology gratifications) that is specific to microblogging. The results suggest that the U&G framework provides a good start for an investigation of the use of new media. However, the results also show that traditional dimensions in the U&G framework do not adequately explain new types of social media. For instance, some widely recognized motivations, such as social gratifications and process gratifications, were not found to be significant in the context of microblogging. Thus, there is a need to explore and validate new dimensions for different types of media.

User satisfaction with microblogging: Information dissemination versus social networking,"Finally, a higher‐order factor model of user satisfaction with microblogging was developed. Social scientists have advocated the use of a hierarchical factor structure for the study of human judgment (Harlow & Newcomb, 1990; Marsh & Hocevar, 1985). They argue that a higher‐order factor model can capture overall user evaluations through the underlying commonality among dimensions in the second‐order factor. In addition, they suggest that a higher‐order factor model alleviates the multicollinearity that may be present among the observed variables and the first‐order unobservable constructs (Reddy & Labarbera, 1985; Weeks, 1980). This was one of the few studies to investigate user satisfaction using a composite latent variable approach (except Cheung and Lee [2008]).

C‐sanitized: A privacy model for document redaction and sanitization,"In comparison with available models (Anandan et al., 2012; Cumby & Ghani, 2011), which assume that all risky terms (sensitive entities or related terms) have been identified a priori, our proposal automatizes both the detection of terms that can disclose sensitive data via semantic inferences and their protection. This relieves human sanitizers from manually identifying related terms, which has been identified as one of the most difficult and time‐consuming challenges (Bier et al., 2009; Gordon, 2013). To do so, our model considers, as human sanitizers do, the semantic relationships by which terms or combinations of terms appearing in a document would disclose sensitive information via semantic inferences. Moreover, our proposal automatizes both the redaction and sanitization of risky terms. Hence, it facilitates the design of automatic methods that cover the whole sanitization/redaction task.",JASIST,Performance Evaluation
C‐sanitized: A privacy model for document redaction and sanitization,"Our approach offers a flexible and intuitive way of setting the privacy requirements in specific scenarios, by stating what is considered sensitive and up to which degree it should be hidden. Contrary to models like t‐plausibility (Anandan et al., 2012), it offers a clear and a priori privacy guarantee on how sensitive entities will be protected, which does not depend on the document size or the number of sensitive entities. Moreover, the privacy criterion can be set using intuitive linguistic labels rather than abstract numbers. As a result, the model can be easily and straightforwardly instantiated according to current legislations and regulations on data privacy (Department for a Healthy New York, 2013; Department of Health and Human Services, 2000; Health Privacy Project, 2013; Legal Information Institute, 2013; Terry & Francis, 2007; European Parliament and the Council of the EU, 1995), whose rules are also expressed linguistically (e.g., disease names, locations, etc.).

Explicit diversification of search results across multiple dimensions for educational search,"We define a new result diversification problem that addresses the typical requirements of a search as learning scenario, that is, where there are a wide range of dimensions the search engine needs to consider when returning results that meet the learning goals (i.e., providing comprehensive information on the topic in many forms (e.g., various types of documents) and at many education levels (e.g., from level 4 to 8)).",JASIST,Theory Proposal
Explicit diversification of search results across multiple dimensions for educational search,"We provide a new framework for diversification, which extends the state‐of‐the‐art diversification methods (namely, xQuAD [Santos, Macdonald, & Ounis, 2010]; a variant of PM2 [Aktolga, 2014] as well as a supervised approach, R‐LTR [Zhu, Lan, Guo, Cheng, & Niu, 2014]), to handle multiple dimensions, and provide tailored instantiations for the framework. Specifically, we enrich each diversification method so that while an aspect's coverage in the final ranking is computed, the importance of the dimension which this aspect belongs to is also taken into account. To illustrate our motivation for computing dimension importance values, let an example query be “triangle,” and assume that the candidate set has documents from all the types available in the system but they all pertain to the education level 4. In this case, the diversification algorithm should focus on diversifying documents w.r.t. The type dimension, since there are several aspects to cover there, but should not attempt to diversify for the education level dimension. Hence, while setting the importance values for certain dimensions adaptively (i.e., per query), we consider the variety of the aspect values observed in the candidate set.",JASIST,New Algorithm or Method or Technology

Considering the positive impact of diversified result presentation on the learning outcomes (e.g., knowledge gains of users) as shown in Collins‐Thompson, Rieh, Haynes, and Syed (2016) and Syed and Collins‐Thompson (2017), these improvements in diversification performance are likely to translate into learning gains in the educational search context, which is the ultimate goal of our present investigation.",JASIST,Performance Evaluation

A simple kernel co‐occurrence‐based enhancement for pseudo‐relevance feedback,"First, for better selection and weighting of the QE terms, we present a kernel‐function weighting formula consisting of a linear combination of two components. The first component is an effective classic PRF model (that is, the Rocchio model or RM3), which calculates the within‐document term weight in a traditional way (that is, the raw term frequency or distribution). The second component can be regarded as a refined version of the PRoc model, which can more effectively capture the proximity information between candidate and query terms in feedback documents. Therefore, the performance of our proposed model can be improved to some extent by adjusting the relative weights between these two components.",JASIST,Model Construction
A simple kernel co‐occurrence‐based enhancement for pseudo‐relevance feedback,"Second, we improve the term co‐occurrence weight formula in our proposed framework. Specifically, in a few previous studies (for instance, Miao et al., 2012; Ye & Huang, 2016), the factor of the term discrimination power in the proposed models has been equal to log((N – N t + 0.5) / (N t + 0.5)), where N t traditionally represents the number of documents containing a specific term. However, in our proposed term co‐occurrence weight formula, we replace N t with another variant that considers the co‐occurrence information in the feedback documents. In other words, we simultaneously incorporate the co‐occurrence information into the calculation of the factor of the term discrimination power and the factor of the within‐document term weight. Thus, the co‐occurrence information is sufficiently utilized in the whole term weight formula to achieve better performance.",JASIST,Model Optimization

Recommendations and privacy in the arXiv system: A simulation experiment using historical data,"he extensive literature on privacy risks has two major streams. One is theoretical, and seeks estimates of the probability that there is any query whose results will reveal an action of one of the system's users. The other exploits the use of side information, in combination with user actions, to unmask users. Instead, we ask how likely it is that aggregated information contained in that system, and used alone, will support a correct inference as to the actions of a specific targeted user. We do not seek to identify which specific individuals are at risk, as the data with which we work will not be made publicly available. We do not use a model in which the attacker exploits side information about the target. We identify two concepts.",JASIST,New Algorithm or Method or Technology

Because translation is done standalone using only neural models, we still refer to this as NMT. In addition, while Wang et al. (2017) applied feedforward networks to model alignment and translation, the recurrent structures proposed in this work surpass the feedforward variants by up to 1.3% in BLEU.",ACL,Performance Evaluation
