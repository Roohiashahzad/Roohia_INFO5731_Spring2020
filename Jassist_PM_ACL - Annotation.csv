The state and evolution of U.S. iSchools: From talent acquisitions to research outcome,"ii) From the standpoint of collecting and analyzing bibliographical data, we retrieved publication data from various types of venues (e.g., journals, conferences, and book chapters), and applied automated topic modeling techniques to reveal research topics for the whole community and each individual iSchool by examining text from these publications. Compared with relying only on journal papers and arbitrary classifications of journals into disciplines (Wu et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013), our approach is more suitable for a multi‐ and interdisciplinary community like the iSchools, whose researchers have diverse preferences regarding publication venues. Our computational analysis also enables us to analyze a large number of publications in an automated way.",JASIST,Theory Proposal,Theory Proposal

The effect of social network site use on the psychological well‐being of cancer patients,"First, most previous studies used quantitative approaches to examine the relationship between SNS use and psychological well‐being. Previous studies collected data from SNSs used by healthy students and attempted to explore how SNS use is related to the psychological well‐being of users. In our study semistructured interviews were conducted to gain a better understanding of how SNS use impacts the psychological well‐being of cancer patients. In the second phase, an online survey was conducted to evaluate and empirically test the theoretical model. We triangulated the results and demonstrated that the use of SNS enhances social support, enriches the experience of social connectedness, develops social presence and learning, and ultimately improves psychological well‐being. This study adds to the literature on SNS use and psychological well‐being and provides a useful platform for future research.",JASIST,Resources,Resources

The MIREX grand challenge: A framework of holistic user‐experience evaluation in music information retrieval,"The article contributes theoretically to MIR evaluation. The holistic user‐experience evaluation approach advocated and implemented in this study is a radical revolution from existing evaluation frameworks including MIREX, MediaEval, and CLEF (discussed later). These existing frameworks focus on subtasks related to components of MIR systems rather than on complete ones. In addition, they largely follow the Cranfield paradigm (Voorhees, 2002), where retrieval systems are compared against common test collections with topics/queries, materials/collections, and relevance/similarity judgments. Putting users and their interactions with complete MIR systems in the center of consideration changes the entire perspective. The evaluation infrastructure no longer consists of predefined queries or ground truth; the evaluation context is shifted from simplified laboratory settings to real‐world scenarios; and the evaluation criteria focus on users' interactions and perceptions.

User satisfaction with microblogging: Information dissemination versus social networking,"First, most previous studies used a quantitative approach to explore the usage patterns among microbloggers. These studies crawled data from microblogging sites and used social network analysis to explore how and why people used microblogging. In this study, a different approach was adopted, and an online survey was conducted to identify key motivations for microblogging and to examine how the fulfillment of these motivations affected user satisfaction. This study triangulated the results and provided empirical support for the hypothesis that people use microblogging as an information‐broadcasting platform, rather than as a social networking site. In addition, the empirical investigation demonstrated the relative importance of various antecedent factors for user satisfaction. This study adds to the limited studies on microblogging usage and provides a platform for future research.

User satisfaction with microblogging: Information dissemination versus social networking,"Second, the U&G framework was used to identify the four major types of motivations for microblogging. Specifically, we identified and proposed a new form of motivation (i.e., technology gratifications) that is specific to microblogging. The results suggest that the U&G framework provides a good start for an investigation of the use of new media. However, the results also show that traditional dimensions in the U&G framework do not adequately explain new types of social media. For instance, some widely recognized motivations, such as social gratifications and process gratifications, were not found to be significant in the context of microblogging. Thus, there is a need to explore and validate new dimensions for different types of media.
",JASIST,Resources,Model Optimization
User satisfaction with microblogging: Information dissemination versus social networking,"Finally, a higher‐order factor model of user satisfaction with microblogging was developed. Social scientists have advocated the use of a hierarchical factor structure for the study of human judgment (Harlow & Newcomb, 1990; Marsh & Hocevar, 1985). They argue that a higher‐order factor model can capture overall user evaluations through the underlying commonality among dimensions in the second‐order factor. In addition, they suggest that a higher‐order factor model alleviates the multicollinearity that may be present among the observed variables and the first‐order unobservable constructs (Reddy & Labarbera, 1985; Weeks, 1980). This was one of the few studies to investigate user satisfaction using a composite latent variable approach (except Cheung and Lee [2008]). Future studies should consider this model structure.",JASIST,Model Construction,Model Construction

C‐sanitized: A privacy model for document redaction and sanitization,"In comparison with available models (Anandan et al., 2012; Cumby & Ghani, 2011), which assume that all risky terms (sensitive entities or related terms) have been identified a priori, our proposal automatizes both the detection of terms that can disclose sensitive data via semantic inferences and their protection. This relieves human sanitizers from manually identifying related terms, which has been identified as one of the most difficult and time‐consuming challenges (Bier et al., 2009; Gordon, 2013). To do so, our model considers, as human sanitizers do, the semantic relationships by which terms or combinations of terms appearing in a document would disclose sensitive information via semantic inferences. Moreover, our proposal automatizes both the redaction and sanitization of risky terms. Hence, it facilitates the design of automatic methods that cover the whole sanitization/redaction task.",JASIST,Model optimization,Performance Evaluation
C‐sanitized: A privacy model for document redaction and sanitization,"Our approach offers a flexible and intuitive way of setting the privacy requirements in specific scenarios, by stating what is considered sensitive and up to which degree it should be hidden. Contrary to models like t‐plausibility (Anandan et al., 2012), it offers a clear and a priori privacy guarantee on how sensitive entities will be protected, which does not depend on the document size or the number of sensitive entities. Moreover, the privacy criterion can be set using intuitive linguistic labels rather than abstract numbers. As a result, the model can be easily and straightforwardly instantiated according to current legislations and regulations on data privacy (Department for a Healthy New York, 2013; Department of Health and Human Services, 2000; Health Privacy Project, 2013; Legal Information Institute, 2013; Terry & Francis, 2007; European Parliament and the Council of the EU, 1995), whose rules are also expressed linguistically (e.g., disease names, locations, etc.).

Specifically, we enrich each diversification method so that while an aspect's coverage in the final ranking is computed, the importance of the dimension which this aspect belongs to is also taken into account. To illustrate our motivation for computing dimension importance values, let an example query be “triangle,” and assume that the candidate set has documents from all the types available in the system but they all pertain to the education level 4. In this case, the diversification algorithm should focus on diversifying documents w.r.t. The type dimension, since there are several aspects to cover there, but should not attempt to diversify for the education level dimension.

Considering the positive impact of diversified result presentation on the learning outcomes (e.g., knowledge gains of users) as shown in Collins‐Thompson, Rieh, Haynes, and Syed (2016) and Syed and Collins‐Thompson (2017), these improvements in diversification performance are likely to translate into learning gains in the educational search context, which is the ultimate goal of our present investigation.",JASIST,Performance Evaluation,performance Evaluation

A simple kernel co‐occurrence‐based enhancement for pseudo‐relevance feedback,"First, for better selection and weighting of the QE terms, we present a kernel‐function weighting formula consisting of a linear combination of two components. The first component is an effective classic PRF model (that is, the Rocchio model or RM3), which calculates the within‐document term weight in a traditional way (that is, the raw term frequency or distribution). The second component can be regarded as a refined version of the PRoc model, which can more effectively capture the proximity information between candidate and query terms in feedback documents. Therefore, the performance of our proposed model can be improved to some extent by adjusting the relative weights between these two components.",JASIST,Model Construction,Model Construction
A simple kernel co‐occurrence‐based enhancement for pseudo‐relevance feedback,"Second, we improve the term co‐occurrence weight formula in our proposed framework. Specifically, in a few previous studies (for instance, Miao et al., 2012; Ye & Huang, 2016), the factor of the term discrimination power in the proposed models has been equal to log((N – N t + 0.5) / (N t + 0.5)), where N t traditionally represents the number of documents containing a specific term. However, in our proposed term co‐occurrence weight formula, we replace N t with another variant that considers the co‐occurrence information in the feedback documents. In other words, we simultaneously incorporate the co‐occurrence information into the calculation of the factor of the term discrimination power and the factor of the within‐document term weight. Thus, the co‐occurrence information is sufficiently utilized in the whole term weight formula to achieve better performance.",JASIST,Applications,Model Optimization

Instead, we ask how likely it is that aggregated information contained in that system, and used alone, will support a correct inference as to the actions of a specific targeted user.
